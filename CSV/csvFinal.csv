Safety and tolerability of an intratumorally injected DNAzyme, Dz13, in patients;with nodular basal-cell carcinoma: a phase 1 first-in-human trial (DISCOVER).|2013|Melanoma|Lancet|Cho, Eun-Ae;Moloney, Fergal J.;Cai, Hong;Au-Yeung, Annie;China, Carlos;Scolyer, Richard A.;Yosufi, Benafsha;Raftery, Mark J.;Deng, Jason Z.;Morton, Stephen W.;Hammond, Paula T.;Arkenau, Hendrik-Tobias;Damian, Diona L.;Francis, Douglas J.;Chesterman, Colin N.;Barnetson, Ross St.C;Halliday, Gary M.;Khachigian, Levon M.|Background: c-Jun, a nuclear transcription factor, is preferentially expressed in;cancer. The study drug Dz13, a deoxyribozyme targeting c-jun mRNA inhibits the;growth of a range of tumors, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in murine;models. Aims: The primary objectives of this first-in-class, first-in-human trial;(DISCOVER) Phase I trial (ACTRN12610000162011) were to determine the safety and;tolerability of Dz13 in patients with BCC. A secondary objective was to assess;Dz13 pharmacokinetics, changes in protein expression and cell markers in the;tissue following single intratumoral injection. Methods: Nine patients with;nodular BCC were recruited from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia;between 2010 and 2011 and enrolled in three escalating dose groups of three;patients. Each patient received a single intratumoral injected dose of Dz13 (10,;30 or 100µg) and was monitored over four weeks. The highest dose used in the;trial (100µg), is at the upper limit of solubility of the formulation for a 50µl;injection and was the highest concentration used in the preclinical mouse tumor;studies 1. At each follow up visit, complete physical examination, blood and;urine tests, electrocardiogram and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were;performed. BCCs were surgically removed 14 days post-Dz13 injection and compared;with the pre-injection biopsy. Findings: All nine patients completed the study;with no drug-related serious adverse events. No systemic Dz13 exposure was;detected. c-Jun expression was reduced in the BCC of all nine of nine;participants treated with Dz13. The DNAzyme increased Caspase-3, -8, -9, and p53,;reduced Bcl-2 and MMP-9, and stimulated inflammatory and immune cell infiltration;in the tumors. Moreover, five of the nine patients had a reduction in;histological tumor depth. Interpretation: Dz13 is safe, well tolerated, inhibits;its target, and shows no detectable systemic exposure following single;intratumoral injection.|65.99
Cardiotoxicity Associated with the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Sunitinib.|2007|Melanoma|Lancet|Chu, Tammy F.;Rupnick, Maria A.;Kerkela, Risto;Dallabrida, Susan M.;Zurakowski, David;Nguyen, Lisa;Woulfe, Kathleen;Pravda, Elke;Cassiola, Flavia;Desai, Jayesh;George, Suzanne;Morgan, Jeffrey A.;Harris, David;Ismail, Nesreen S.;Chen, Jey-Hsin;Schoen, Frederick J.|Background: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have advanced cancer treatment.;Sunitinib, a recently-approved, multi-targeted TKI, prolongs survival for;patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal;tumor (GIST), but concerns about cardiac safety have arisen with this agent.;Methods: To determine the cardiovascular risk associated with sunitinib, we;reviewed all cardiovascular events in patients with imatinib-resistant,;metastatic GIST at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute enrolled in a Phase I/II;protocol evaluating the efficacy of the drug (n=75). Sunitinib’s effects on left;ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and blood pressure (BP) were also examined.;Studies in isolated cardiomyocytes and mice investigated potential mechanisms of;sunitinib-associated cardiac effects. Findings: Eleven percent (8/75) of subjects;suffered a cardiovascular event with congestive heart failure (CHF) occurring in;8% (6/75) of the population. Twenty-eight percent (10/36) of patients treated at;the FDA-approved dose had LVEF declines of = 10 EF%, and nineteen percent (7/36);experienced LVEF declines of = 15 EF%. Sunitinib induced significant increases in;mean systolic and diastolic BP in patients, and 47% (35/75) of individuals;developed hypertension (HTN) (>150/100 mmHg). CHF and LV dysfunction generally;responded to withholding drug and instituting medical management. In mice and;cultured cardiomyocytes, sunitinib caused mitochondrial injury and cardiomyocyte;apoptosis. Interpretation: Sunitinib treatment can lead to HTN, LVEF decline,;and/or CHF. Experimental studies suggest that this is due, at least in part, to;direct cardiomyocyte toxicity which may be exacerbated by HTN. Patients treated;with sunitinib should receive close monitoring and prompt treatment for HTN;and/or LVEF decline.|65.83
Cutaneous Malignancies among HIV-Infected Persons.|2009|Melanoma|Archives Of Internal Medicine|Crum-Cianflone, Nancy;Hullsiek, Katherine Huppler;Satter, Elizabeth;Marconi, Vincent;Weintrob, Amy;Ganesan, Anuradha;Barthel, R. Vincent;Fraser, Susan;Agan, Brian K.|Background: As life expectancy of HIV-infected persons increases, cancers have;become an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Although cutaneous;neoplasms are the most common malignancies in the general population, little data;exist among HIV-positive persons especially regarding the impact of HIV-specific;factors. Methods: We evaluated the incidence rates and factors associated with;the development of cutaneous malignancies among HIV-infected persons by examining;prospectively collected data from a large HIV Natural History Study composed of;4,490 persons (1986 to 2006). Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards;models were performed. Results: Six percent (n=254) of HIV-infected persons;developed a cutaneous malignancy during 33,760 person-years of follow-up (mean;7.5 years). Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),;incidence rates of cutaneous non-AIDS defining cancers (NADCs), in particular;basal cell carcinoma, have exceeded rates of cutaneous AIDS-defining cancers such;as Kaposi’s sarcoma. Factors associated with the development of cutaneous NADCs;in the multivariate models included increasing age (hazard ratio (HR) 2.1; 95% CI;1.7–2.6) and race. Compared to white/non-Hispanic race, African Americans (HR;0.03, 95% CI 0.01–0.14) and other races (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03, 0.57) had a lower;risk of cutaneous NADCs. There were no significant associations between cutaneous;NADCs and time-updated CD4 counts, HIV RNA levels, or HAART receipt. Conclusions:;NADCs are now the most common cutaneous malignancies among HIV-infected persons.;Cutaneous NADCs do not appear to be significantly associated with immune function;or HAART, but rather are related to traditional factors, such as aging and skin;color.|25.17
Association Between Statin Use and Risk for Keratinocyte Carcinoma in the;Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention Trial.|2009|Melanoma|Annals Of Internal Medicine|Dore, David D.;Lapane, Kate L.;Trivedi, Amal N.;Mor, Vincent;Weinstock, Martin A.|Background: Recent evidence suggests that statins may prevent cancer. Objective:;To quantify the association between statin use and the occurrence of keratinocyte;carcinoma in high-risk veterans. Design: Cohort study. Setting: 6 Veterans;Affairs medical centers. Participants: 1037 participants of the Veterans Affairs;Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention Trial, a randomized, multicenter, double-blind,;vehicle-controlled trial of topical tretinoin, 0.1%, for prevention of;keratinocyte carcinoma conducted from November 1998 to November 2004.;Measurements: Time to first occurrence of keratinocyte carcinoma on the face or;ears. Participants using a statin at randomization, according to the Veterans;Affairs Pharmacy Benefits Management database, were considered exposed. Study;dermatologists conducted physical examinations at baseline and every 6 months;during follow-up. The association between statin use at randomization and the;outcome was evaluated by using propensity score matching (n = 608) and Cox;proportional hazards regression (n = 1037). Results: Among the 1037 participants,;37% used a statin at randomization (n = 397) for a median duration of at least;900 days over a median follow-up of 3.5 years. In the propensity score-matched;analysis, statin use at randomization was not associated with keratinocyte;carcinoma (rate ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.16]), a finding that was;consistent with the estimates derived from the Cox proportional hazards;regression (rate ratio, 0.84 [CI, 0.70 to 1.02]). Limitations: The extent of;residual confounding is unknown, and the confidence bounds around the measures of;association were wide. These data may not be generalizable to lower-risk;populations. Conclusion: These data show no conclusive or consistent relationship;between long-term statin use and risk for keratinocyte carcinoma.

Outcomes of Screening Mammography by Frequency, Breast Density, and;Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy.|2013|Melanoma|Jama Internal Medicine|Kerlikowske, Karla;Zhu, Weiwei;Hubbard, Rebecca A.;Geller, Berta;Dittus, Kim;Braithwaite, Dejana;Wernli, Karen J.;Miglioretti, Diana L.;O’Meara, Ellen S.|Importance: Controversy exists about the frequency women should undergo screening;mammography and whether screening interval should vary according to risk factors;beyond age. Objective: To compare the benefits and harms of screening mammography;frequencies according to age, breast density, and postmenopausal hormone therapy;(HT) use. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Data collected January 1994 to;December 2008 from mammography facilities in community practice that participate;in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) mammography registries.;Participants: Data were collected prospectively on 11 474 women with breast;cancer and 922 624 without breast cancer who underwent mammography at facilities;that participate in the BCSC. Main Outcomes and Measures: We used logistic;regression to calculate the odds of advanced stage (IIb, III, or IV) and large;tumors (>20 mm in diameter) and 10-year cumulative probability of a;false-positive mammography result by screening frequency, age, breast density,;and HT use. The main predictor was screening mammography interval. Results:;Mammography biennially vs annually for women aged 50 to 74 years does not;increase risk of tumors with advanced stage or large size regardless of women’s;breast density or HT use. Among women aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense;breasts, biennial mammography vs annual is associated with increased risk of;advanced-stage cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% CI, 1.06–3.39) and large tumors;(OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.37–4.18). Cumulative probability of a false-positive;mammography result was high among women undergoing annual mammography with;extremely dense breasts who were either aged 40 to 49 years (65.5%) or used;estrogen plus progestogen (65.8%) and was lower among women aged 50 to 74 years;who underwent biennial or triennial mammography with scattered fibroglandular;densities (30.7% and 21.9%, respectively) or fatty breasts (17.4% and 12.1%,;respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Women aged 50 to 74 years, even those;with high breast density or HT use, who undergo biennial screening mammography;have similar risk of advanced-stage disease and lower cumulative risk of;false-positive results than those who undergo annual mammography. When deciding;whether to undergo mammography, women aged 40 to 49 years who have extremely;dense breasts should be informed that annual mammography may minimize their risk;of advanced-stage disease but the cumulative risk of false-positive results is;high.|14.5
Skin Diseases in Family Medicine: Prevalence and Health Care Use.|2008|Melanoma|Annals Of Family Medicine|Verhoeven, Elisabeth W. M.;Kraaimaat, Floor W.;van Weel, Chris;van de Kerkhof, Peter C. M.;Duller, Piet;van der Valk, Pieter G. M.;van den Hoogen, Henk J. M.;Bor, J. Hans J.;Schers, Henk J.;Evers, Andrea W. M.|PURPOSE Ongoing care for patients with skin diseases can be optimized by;understanding the incidence and population prevalence of various skin diseases;and the patient-related factors related to the use of primary, specialty, and;alternative health care for these conditions. We examined the recent prevalence;of skin diseases in a defined population of family medicine patients,;self-reported disease-related quality of life, extent and duration of skin;disease, and the use of health care by patients with skin diseases.METHODS We;undertook a morbidity registry-based epidemiological study to determine the;prevalence of various skin diseases, using a patient questionnaire to inquire;about health care use, within a network of family practices in the Netherlands;with a practice population of approximately 12,000 citizens.RESULTS Skin diseases;accounted for 12.4% of all diseases seen by the participating family physicians.;Of the 857 questionnaires sent to patients registered with a skin disease, 583;(68.0%) were returned, and 501 were suitable for analysis. In the previous year,;83.4% of the patients had contacted their family physician for their skin;disease, 17.0% had contacted a medical specialist, and 5.2% had consulted an;alternative health care practitioner. Overall, 65.1% contacted only their family;physician. Patients who reported more severe disease and lower quality of life;made more use of all forms of health care.CONCLUSION This practice;population-based study found that skin diseases account for 12.4% of diseases;seen by family physicians, and that some skin problems may be seen more;frequently. Although patients with more extensive skin diseases also obtain care;from dermatologists, most patients have their skin diseases treated mainly by;their family physician. Overall, patients with more severe disease and a lower;quality of life seek more treatment.|9.24
Racial, Social, and Clinical Determinants of Hepatocellular Carcinoma;Surveillance.|2015|Melanoma|The American Journal Of Medicine|Singal, Amit G.;Li, Xilong;Tiro, Jasmin;Kandunoori, Pragathi;Adams-Huet, Beverley;Nehra, Mahendra S.;Yopp, Adam|Background: Fewer than 1 in 5 patients receive hepatocellular carcinoma;surveillance; however, most studies were performed in racially and;socioeconomically homogenous populations and few used guideline-based definitions;for surveillance. Aims: To characterize guideline-consistent hepatocellular;carcinoma surveillance rates and identify determinants of hepatocellular;carcinoma surveillance among a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of;cirrhotic patients. Methods: We retrospectively characterized hepatocellular;carcinoma surveillance among cirrhotic patients followed between July 2008 and;July 2011 at an urban safety-net hospital. Inconsistent surveillance was defined;as at least one screening ultrasound during the 3-year period, annual;surveillance as screening ultrasounds every 12 months, and biannual surveillance;as screening ultrasounds every 6 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses;were conducted to identify predictors of surveillance. Results: Of 904 cirrhotic;patients, 603 (67%) underwent inconsistent surveillance. Failure to recognize;cirrhosis was a significant barrier to surveillance utilization (p<0.001).;Inconsistent surveillance was associated with insurance status (OR 1.43, 95%CI;1.03–1.98), multiple primary care visits per year (OR 2.63, 95%CI 1.86–3.71),;multiple hepatology visits per year (OR 3.75, 95%CI 2.64–5.33), African American;race (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.42–0.99), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis etiology (OR 0.60,;95%CI 0.37–0.98), and extrahepatic cancer (OR 0.43, 95%CI 0.24–0.77). Only 98;(13.4%) of 730 patients underwent annual surveillance, and only 13 (1.7%) of 786;had biannual surveillance. Conclusions: Only 13% of patients with cirrhosis;receive annual surveillance and less than 2% receive biannual surveillance. There;are racial and socioeconomic disparities, with lower rates of hepatocellular;carcinoma surveillance among African Americans and underinsured patients.|7.28
First In-human Intraoperative Imaging of HCC using Fluorescence Goggle System and;Transarterial Delivery of Near-infrared Fluorescent Imaging Agent: a Pilot Study.|2013|Melanoma|Translational Research : The Journal Of Laboratory And Clinical Medicine|Liu, Yang;Zhao, Yi-Ming;Akers, Walter;Tang, Zhao-You;Fan, Jia;Sun, Hui-Chuan;Ye, Qing-Hai;Wang, Lu;Achilefu, Samuel|Surgical resections remain the primary curative interventions for hepatocellular;carcinoma (HCC). However, lack of real-time intraoperative image guidance;confines surgeons to subjective visual assessment of the surgical bed, leading to;poor visualization of small positive nodules and the extension of diffuse HCC. To;address this problem, we developed a wearable fluorescence imaging and display;system (fluorescence goggle) for intraoperative imaging of HCCs in human;patients. In this pilot study, both intravenous (i.v.) and transarterial hepatic;(TAH) delivery of indocyanine green (ICG) were explored to facilitate;fluorescence goggle-mediated HCC imaging. The results show that all primary;tumors in patients (n=4) who received TAH delivery of ICG were successfully;identified by the fluorescence goggle. In addition, 6 satellite tumors were also;detected by the goggle, 5 of which were neither identifiable in pre-operative MRI;and CT images nor by visual inspection and palpation. In the group (n=5) that;received ICG by i.v., only 2 out of 6 tumors visible in the pre-operative MRI or;CT images were identified with the fluorescence goggle, demonstrating the;limitation of this delivery route for a non-tumor selective imaging agent.;Comparative analysis shows that the HCC-to-liver florescence contrast detected by;the goggle was significantly higher in patients that received TAH than i.v.;delivery of ICG (P=0.013). This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using;the fluorescence goggle to identify multifocal lesions and small tumor deposits;using TAH ICG delivery in HCC patients.|7.27
A Case of the Intrapulmonary Spread of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis With;Malignant Transformation.|2015|Carcinoma|The American Journal Of The Medical Sciences|Xiao, Yang;Wang, Jun;Han, Demin;Ma, Lijing|Objectives:: To describe an individual with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis;that extended into the lung parenchyma and underwent malignant transformation and;to discuss the characteristic imaging findings associated with this condition.;Methods:: The clinical presentation of an individual with this unusual malignant;transformation was reviewed. A literature search was performed to characterize;the epidemiology, imaging findings and management of this condition. Results::;The patient underwent 30 courses of surgery over 21 years and presented;disseminated pulmonary papilloma after childbirth. The interval between;dissemination into the lung and malignant transformation was 2.5 years. The;tracheal papilloma was positive for type 6 of human papilloma virus (HPV-6). She;died because she refused further treatment. Conclusions:: The clinician should;have a high index of suspicion for lung papillomatosis in patients with a;tracheotomy. Appropriate diagnostic imaging studies will be helpful in reaching;this diagnosis and determining whether a malignancy exists. Treatment options;have limited success when lung papillomatosis becomes malignant.|7.05
Progress against Cancer (1971–2011): How far have we come?|2012|Melanoma|Journal Of Internal Medicine|Tiwari, Ashish K.;Roy, Hemant K.|“The big C”, a common euphemism for cancer, has loomed large on the collective;psyche of the mankind for centuries, not least because of the relative dearth of;effective treatment against this disease but its ability to relentlessly evade;them and come back to haunt us. However, the struggle against cancer took a;decisive turn in 1971 when a relentless campaigning by health activists;eventually led to signing of the National Cancer Act in the United States, an;unprecedented event in the history of diseases. As we commemorate the 40th;anniversary of the signing of that historic legislation, an assessment of the;progress against cancer would naturally help us understand how we have fared so;far in this struggle, and guide us in our efforts to re-strategize and re-deploy;our limited resources to their best use against this immortal enemy.|7.02
Physical Activity and Esophageal and Gastric Carcinoma in a Large Prospective;Study.|2009|Carcinoma|American Journal Of Preventive Medicine|Leitzmann, Michael F.;Koebnick, Corinna;Freedman, Neal D.;Park, Yikyung;Ballard-Barbash, Rachel;Hollenbeck, Albert;Schatzkin, Arthur;Abnet, Christian C.|Background: Few studies have investigated the relationship of physical activity;to esophageal and gastric carcinoma according to histology and anatomic site.;Methods: This study prospectively investigated the association between physical;activity and esophageal and gastric carcinoma in a cohort of 487,732 U.S. men and;women, followed from 1995–1996 to December 31, 2003. All analyses were performed;in 2007– 2008. Results: During 8 years of follow-up study, 523 cases of;esophageal carcinoma (149 squamous cell and 374 adenocarcinoma) and 642 cases of;gastric carcinoma (313 cardia and 329 noncardia) were documented. Physical;activity was associated with reduced risk of esophageal and gastric;adenocarcinomas but was unrelated to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The;inverse association with physical activity was strongest for gastric noncardia;adenocarcinoma (multivariate relative risk [RR] for highest versus lowest;physical activity level=0.62, 95% CI=0.44, 0.87). Relationships were weaker but;evident for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (RR=0.83; 95% CI=0.58, 1.19) and;esophageal adenocarcinoma (RR=0.75; 95% CI=0.53, 1.06). No significant;relationship with physical activity was observed for esophageal squamous cell;carcinoma (RR=1.05; 95% CI=0.64, 1.74). Exclusion of cases diagnosed during the;first 2 follow-up years did not change those estimates, indicating that the;findings are not due to decreased activity levels among participants with;undiagnosed cancer at entry. Conclusions: Physical activity may play a role in;the prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas. No association;was seen between physical activity and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.|5.46
Physician Supply and Breast Cancer Survival.|2010|Carcinoma|Journal Of The American Board Of Family Medicine : Jabfm|Gorey, Kevin M.;Luginaah, Isaac N.;Fung, Karen Y.;Bartfay, Emma;Hamm, Caroline;Wright, Frances C.;Balagurusamy, Madhan;Holowaty, Eric J.|Background: This study tested the hypothesis that physician supply thresholds are;associated with breast cancer survival in Ontario. Methods: The 5-year survival;of 17,820 female breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1995 and 1997 was;surveilled until 2003 for all-cause mortality. Physician supply densities in 1991;and 2001 were computed for 49 Ontario regions. Results: There were independent;threshold effects for general practitioners (GP; 7.25 per 10,000) and;obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYN; 6 per 100,000) at or above which women with;breast cancer were more likely to survive for 5 years. The respective risk of;living in areas undersupplied with OB/GYN and GP increased 30% to nearly 5-fold;during the 1990s. Five-year survival tended to be lower in provincial areas;outside of Toronto, which experienced GP (odds ratio, 0.83; 90% CI, 0.70–0.99);and OB/GYN (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.96) supply decreases. Conclusion: As;they do in America, primary care physician supplies in Canada seem to matter in;the effective provision of cancer care. Community resources such as health care;service endowments, including physician supplies, may be particularly critical to;the performance of health care systems such as Canada’s, which aim to provide;medically necessary care for all.|5.19
Carcinoma of the Larynx: Results of Therapy.|1964|Melanoma|Canadian Medical Association Journal|Bryce, Douglas P.|Prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma varies considerably, depending on its site and;stage of development. In the past, laryngectomy was considered the treatment of;choice for all but very early lesions. Results of therapy and five-year survival;rates were relatively good, but the patient deprived of his larynx frequently;presented difficulties in rehabilitation.Recent advances in radiotherapy;techniques have permitted treatment of a greater proportion of patients with;laryngeal carcinoma by this means, with encouraging results. Results of a survey;in the Toronto area suggest that radiotherapy should be used as primary treatment;in early and intermediate stages of the disease; radical excision combined with;radiotherapy is indicated for treatment failures among early cases and for those;with far-advanced disease or carcinoma outside the larynx proper. With this;program five-year survival rates are comparable to those achieved when;laryngectomy is the primary treatment used, and two-thirds of those who survive;maintain laryngeal function.|3.69
MicroRNAs: critical mediators of differentiation, development and disease.|2009|Carcinoma|Swiss Medical Weekly|Friedman, Jeffrey M.;Jones, Peter A.|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are expressed in higher;eukaryoates and have even been found in viral genomes. They usually act as;endogenous repressors of target genes by either inhibiting translation, causing;mRNA degradation, or by a combination of both mechanisms. More than 850 mature;miRNA sequences have been identified in humans, and although this accounts for;less than 2% of human genes, it is predicted that 30% of mRNAs are targeted by;miRNAs. miRNAs play critical roles in most cellular processes including;development, differentiation, and the homeostasis of both a cell and an organism.;Moreover, many disease states, including cancer, occur or are sustained by miRNA;dysregulation. Here we will review the latest reports of miRNA involvement and;aberrant expression in human disease with an emphasis on cancer.|3.26
Educating osteopaths to be researchers – what role should research methods and;statistics have in an undergraduate curriculum?|2008|Carcinoma|International Journal Of Osteopathic Medicine : Ijom|Licciardone, John C.|Evidence-based medicine (EBM) involves using research data to enhance the;diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. Somatic dysfunction and;osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) are two unique aspects of osteopathy;that will benefit from a greater emphasis on scientific evidence. Most evidence;in osteopathy is based on expert opinions, case reports, case series, and;observational studies. Only one systematic review of randomized controlled;trials, involving OMT for low back pain, has been published. Although this study;demonstrates the efficacy of OMT for low back pain, other clinical trials are;needed to expand the evidence base in osteopathy. Undergraduate osteopathy;curricula should ensure that students acquire the tools necessary to become;knowledgeable consumers of the research and statistics presented in biomedical;journals. Such curricula need to be supplemented with graduate training programs;and research funding mechanisms to ensure that young osteopathic researchers are;able to produce the research needed to practice and advance evidence-based;osteopathy in the future.|2.96
The gastro-esophageal malignancies in Northern Iran research project: impact on;the health research and health care systems in Iran.|2013|Melanoma|Archives Of Iranian Medicine|Sepanlou, Sadaf G.;Etemadi, Arash;Kamangar, Farin;Pourshams, Akram;Poustchi, Hossein;Islami, Farhad;Sadjadi, Alireza;Nasrollahzadeh, Dariush;Semnani, Shahryar;Abnet, Christian;Ponder, Bruce;Pharoh, Paul;day, Nick;Brennan, Paul;Boffetta, Paolo;Dawsey, Sanford M;Malekzadeh, Reza|Since 2000, considerable progress has been made in health research in Iran. An;example of this progress has been the Gastro- Esophageal Malignancies in Northern;Iran (GEMINI). The original aim of this project was to identify etiologic factors;and prevention measures for upper gastrointestinal cancers in Northern provinces;of Iran, but its achievements have gone much beyond the initial goal. This;project is one of the largest studies in the Middle East and North African;region, has helped build and strengthen research capacity at both individual and;institutional levels in Iran, and has provided international credibility to;research institutes and the wider research system in Iran. The success of GEMINI;reveals the feasibility of large-scale studies in developing countries and serves;as a successful model not only for health research institutes within Iran, but;also for research systems in other developing countries. The outcomes of the;project are numerous, including establishment of research networks, development;of efficient methods for planning and implementation of research projects, and;introduction of methodologies for project management, data management and usage;of health technology. Finally and perhaps most importantly, GEMINI is among the;few projects that has had a significant impact on the attitudes and concerns of;decision makers in the health sector in Iran. It signifies the importance of;investment in human resources and has proved that health policies should be;health-based rather than patient-based. Here we review the impact of GEMINI on;the health research system and the broader health care system of Iran and put;these into a more global perspective.|2.7

Study;Design:: A retrospective review Setting:: An Academic Tertiary center;Subjects/Methods:: An analysis of oncologic outcomes from 25 patients treated in;our department for medullary thyroid carcinoma is performed, together with a;comparison of relevant studies over the literature. Results:: The incidence of;patients alive free of disease and the 5-year survival rate has been noticed to;be slightly higher than the rate reported in most series. Conclusions:: Total;thyroidectomy and neck dissection remains the gold standard in the treatment of;medullary thyroid carcinoma. Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical treatment;lead to lower rates of recurrence and invasiveness. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor,;especially vantetanib, appears to be a promising target for treatment.|2.12
Oral cancer in the UAE: a multicenter, retrospective study.|2013|Carcinoma|The Libyan Journal Of Medicine|Anis, Raeefa;Gaballah, Kamis|Aim: To determine the prevalence of various malignant oral lesions in the UAE and;correlate cases of squamous cell carcinomas with age, gender, site, grade,;clinical presentations at the time of diagnosis, and the prevalence of neck;metastasis. Materials and methods: A multicenter, retrospective study was;conducted at four major hospitals in the UAE. The study was based on;histopathology reports of biopsies of oral tissues. Results: Of the 992 oral;biopsy reports retrieved, 147 cases of malignant tumors were found which;accounted for 14.9% of the total biopsies. Fifteen different types of malignant;lesions were diagnosed, of which oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was the most;prevalent and made up 11.4% of the overall oral biopsies retrieved. The commonest;presentation of cancer was ulceration (31.17%), followed by lumps and white;lesions. The most common site where the lesions were diagnosed was the tongue;(51.9%), followed by the cheeks and lips. OSCC accounted for 77% of all;malignancies reported. Neck dissections were conducted in only 20.8% of all OSCC;cases diagnosed at Mafraq and Tawam hospitals, of which 43.75% showed evidence of;neck metastasis. Conclusion: Oral cancer is not an uncommon disease in the UAE.;This may mandate more awareness campaigning, including screening procedures for;early detection of cancerous lesions and other potentially malignant oral;diseases. Elective neck dissections to detect lymph node metastasis should be;more routinely performed, in particular for tongue carcinomas because of the;early neck involvement potential.|2.1
AGO Austria recommendations for genetic testing of patients with ovarian cancer.|2015|Carcinoma|Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift|Marth, Christian;Hubalek, Michael;Petru, Edgar;Polterauer, Stephan;Reinthaller, Alexander;Schauer, Christian;Scholl-Firon, Tonja;Singer, Christian F.;Zschocke, Johannes;Zeimet, Alain G.|In Austria, 700 women are diagnosed every year with ovarian carcinoma.;Approximately 15?% of the patients with epithelial ovarian cancer have a germline;mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The increased incidence of breast and/or;ovarian cancer in genetically related family members has given rise to the term;“hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome” (HBOC). Some 25–55?% of these;in-family diseases are attributed to germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, and;approximately 5–10?% to other known tumor predisposition syndromes. The remaining;persons may carry mutations in as yet unidentified genes. HBOC caused by BRCA1;and BRCA2 mutations is an autosomal dominant disorder with high penetrance. BRCA1;and BRCA2 encode for so-called tumor suppressor proteins. Inherited functional;mutations of these genes cause loss of function of the respective allele. Loss of;function of the second allele causes complete loss of the corresponding protein;and facilitates the development of a malignancy.The Association of Gynecologic;Oncology recommends that testing for a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 should;be offered to all patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. When mutations in;BRCA1, BRCA2, or other cancer-susceptibility genes have been identified, patients;with ovarian carcinoma can be treated with new, innovative therapies. This;recommendation is intended as a standard guideline for genetic testing of;patients with an ovarian carcinoma.|1.93
